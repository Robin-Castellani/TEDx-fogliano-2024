# Code and slides of the 2024-11-09 TEDx Lago di Fogliano <br> Title: "Dal rapporto IPCC all'azione: cambiare il futuro climatico" <br> by Robin Castellani

This repo collects the geospatial data and the Jupyter notebooks used to produce the slides of [the TEDx 2024 @Lago di Fogliano](https://www.tedxlagodifogliano.com/).

The original netCDFs downloaded from the [Copernicus CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) are stored in `/data` folder, as well as the other non-geospatial datasets.
<br>
Each `.ipynb` notebook is dedicated to process a different dataset; they create a `.svg` image or a `.gif` used in the slides.
<br>
Finally, the `.pptx` slides are the one you'll see me presenting in the TEDx. Soooo intense!
